# Python College Lab: Projects, DSA, and Practice

Welcome to the Python College Lab repository! This collection features a wide range of Python projects, coding exercises, data structures & algorithms (DSA) practice, and solutions to problems from popular platforms like GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, and HackerRank. It also includes lecture notes, semester experiments, and practicals for college coursework.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. **Explore by topic:**
   - Open any folder to find Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`) for that topic.
   - Use JupyterLab, VSCode, or your favorite IDE to run and experiment with the code.

3. **Contributions:**
   - Feel free to submit pull requests for new problems, improved solutions, or additional notes!
